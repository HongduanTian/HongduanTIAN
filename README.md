### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Hongduan Tian

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student @ Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR) in the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Baptist University, supervised by [Dr. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/index.html) and [Dr. Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/index.html).

Before that, I obtained my B.E. and M.E. degrees from Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, and fortunately supervised by [Prof. Xiao-Tong Yuan](https://sites.google.com/site/xtyuan1980/) and [Prof. Qingshan Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Pyf20IAAAAJ&hl=en).

My interests mainly include:
- Meta-Learning
- Few-shot Learning

- Learning Theory

I am always open for collaborations. If you are interested, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:hongduan.tian@gmail.com)!
